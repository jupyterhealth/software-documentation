# How-To guides

here we should have [how-to guides](https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides/) for specific operations.

> How-to guides are directions that guide the reader through a problem or towards a result. How-to guides are goal-oriented.

Note: [the difference between how-to and tutorial](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials-how-to/)

How-to documents we plan to have:

For JupyterHealth Exchange deployers/admins:

- Configuring JupyterHealth for HIPAA-compliant storage
- Connecting JupyterHealth to a new wearable API
- Troubleshooting common ingestion errors
- Upgrading JupyterHealth
- Add a data source, data type to the Exchange

For practitioners:

- Using the JupyterHealth REST API
- create a study
- add a patient
- fetch data from the exchange
