title: JupyterHealth Software Documentation
---

## The Platform

[JupyterHealth](https://jupyterhealth.org) is an open-source, modular platform that eliminates data silos by integrating real-time health data from wearables, IoT devices, mobile apps, and Electronic Health Records (EHRs) into a unified, secure, and AI-powered ecosystem.

## The Software

A JupyterHealth deployment can be characterized as a JupyterHub with the ability to integrate with a JupyterHealth Exchange service. This documentation will help organizations understand and deploy these applications.

## Development

This documentation site is a work in progress!
See our plan [on github](https://github.com/jupyterhealth/software-documentation/issues/39), and join the conversation and ask questions.
Questions help guide us in what to get to first.

Development is discussed in:

- the `#jupyter-health-software` channel on 2i2c's Slack instance
- we have created a [#jupyterhealth](https://jupyter.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/531270-jupyterhealth) channel in the Jupyter Zulip, and are working to move more conversations into the open. Come say hi!
- the [jupyterhealth/jupyter-health-software](https://github.com/jupyterhealth/jupyter-health-software) github repository
