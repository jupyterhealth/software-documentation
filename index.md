# Introduction

A JupyterHealth deployment can be characterized as a JupyterHub with the ability to integrate with a [JupyterHealth Exchange](jupyterhealth-exchange/overview) service.

The long term goal is for an organization to be able to deploy a JupyterHub within their existing infrastructure and accessible through existing platforms.

## Development

Development is discussed in:

- the `#jupyter-health-software` channel on 2i2c's Slack instance
- the [jupyterhealth/jupyter-health-software](https://github.com/jupyterhealth/jupyter-health-software) github repository
