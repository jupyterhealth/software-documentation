# Explanations

Here we will have [explanations](https://diataxis.fr/explanation/) for learning about JupyterHealth.

> Explanation is a discursive treatment of a subject, that permits reflection. Explanation is understanding-oriented.

We hope to have the following documents:

- JupyterHealth: A conceptual overview
- Data flow: Acquisition → Exchange → Analysis
- Consent and Identity Management
- Security Overview (HIPAA, GDPR considerations)
- Interoperability with FHIR, OMOP, Open mHealth
- JupyterHealth RBAC and Governance
- Architecture of JupyterHealth components, and how they work together
- Access control design of the Exchange
