## The Platform

[JupyterHealth](https://jupyterhealth.org) is an open-source, modular platform that eliminates data silos by integrating real-time health data from wearables, IoT devices, mobile apps, and Electronic Health Records (EHRs) into a unified, secure, and AI-powered ecosystem.

## The Software

A JupyterHealth deployment can be characterized as a JupyterHub with the ability to integrate with a [JupyterHealth Exchange](jupyterhealth-exchange/overview) service. This documentation will help organizations understand and deploy these applications.

## Development

Development is discussed in:

- the `#jupyter-health-software` channel on 2i2c's Slack instance
- the [jupyterhealth/jupyter-health-software](https://github.com/jupyterhealth/jupyter-health-software) github repository
