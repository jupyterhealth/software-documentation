# Tutorials

Here we will have [tutorials](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/) for learning about JupyterHealth.

> A tutorial is an experience that takes place under the guidance of a tutor. A tutorial is always learning-oriented.

Note: [the difference between how-to and tutorial](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials-how-to/).

## Available Tutorials

- **[Your First Local JupyterHealth Exchange](local-exchange-deployment.md)** - Deploy JupyterHealth Exchange on your computer in 15 minutes and explore example research data
- **[Deploying JupyterHealth Exchange on Kubernetes](exchange-on-kubernetes.md)** - Deploy a production JupyterHealth Exchange on AWS with Kubernetes

## Planned Tutorials

- "Zero to JupyterHealth" - deploying JupyterHealth in the cloud on AWS (or whatever)
- Installation and First Setup
- Acquiring Data from Wearables (Dexcom, Oura, CareX)
- Running Your First Analysis in a Notebook
- Deploying a standalone JupyterHealth Hub
- Fetching and viewing data from the Exchange with JupyterHealth Client
- Launch a JupyterHealth-powered dashboard via SMART-on-FHIR (medplum example)

Borderline tutorial/how-to depending on what we choose to write:

- Ingesting FHIR Data into JHE
- Uploading an existing dataset into JHE
